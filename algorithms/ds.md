data structures

hashmap / dictionary -> associative array where lookup is constant o(1).
array -> iterable collection of elements, 0 indexed.
stack -> FIFO, like a stack of plates, elements are pushed to the top, you can only pop the top element off.

algorithms
two pointer algorithm 
  -> left pointer at 0, right pointer at end of array
  -> if left is smaller than right, increase left
  -> if right is smaller than left, decrease right
  -> loop while left is smaller than right

Common time complexities:
- Constant time O(1)
  - Runtime does not change with input size
  - Ex. arr[i] look up is constant time
- Logarithmic time O(log n)
  - runtime grows logarithmically with input size
  - Ex. Binary search
- Linear time O(n)
  - runtime grows proportionally with input size
  - Looping through an array
- Linearrithmic time O(n log n)
  - Common in efficient sorting algorithms
  - Merge sort
- Quadratic time O(N^2)
  - runtime grows proportionally to the square of the input size
  - Nested loops
- Cubic Time O(N^3)
  - runtime grows porportionally to the cube of the input size
  - Some brute-force algorithms with 3 nested loops
- Exponential time (2^n)
  - Runtime doubles with each additional input element
  - Recursive fibonacci
- Factorial time O(n!)
  - Runtime grows factorially, extreamely inefficient
  - Brute force permutations, traveling salesman problem

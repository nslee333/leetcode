# dyanmic arrays runtime complexities

# appending is O(1), majority of the time, but when resizing occurs, it takes O(n)

# indexing = constant O(1)

# insertion = O(n), worst case, shifting elements may be required

# deletion = O(n) shifting elements may be needed

# resizing = o(n), when capacity doubles, all elements must be copied

array = []
